    """Base class for evaluation aggregators.

    An aggregator takes a flat list of EvaluationReports (produced by an
    Experiment) and re-groups/analyzes them along a specific dimension
    (e.g., chaos scenarios, trials, case categories).

    The default implementation groups by evaluator name and computes numeric
    stats across all cases. Subclasses can override:
        - `aggregate()` for custom grouping logic
        - `summarize_reasons()` for LLM-based or domain-specific narrative generation

    Example::

        from strands_evals.aggregators import EvaluationAggregator

        aggregator = EvaluationAggregator()
        reports = experiment.run_evaluations(task=my_task)
        results = aggregator.aggregate(reports)
